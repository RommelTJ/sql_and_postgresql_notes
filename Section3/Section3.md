# Working with Tables

What Tables Should we make?
Common features are frequently built with conventional table names and columns.
Google: "sql schema upvote system".

What type of resources exist in your app? Create a separate table for each of these features.

Features that seem to indicate a relationship or ownership between two types of resources need to be reflected in our 
table design.
