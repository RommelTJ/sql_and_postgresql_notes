# Database Design

1. What kind of thing are we storing?
2. What properties does this thing have?
3. What type of data does each of those properties contain?

A table is a collection of records.

A column records one property about a 'thing'.

A row represents a record, i.e. the 'thing'.

Keywords tell the database that we want to do something. 

Identifiers tell the database what the thing we want to act on.

SQL is not just about pulling raw data out of a table. We can also transform or process data before we receive it.

Math Operators:

^ -> Exponent

@ -> Absolute Value

```  

String Operators:
```
|| -> Join two strings
CONCAT() -> Join two strings
LOWER() -> Gives a lower case string
LENGTH() -> Gives number of characters in string
UPPER() -> Gives an upper case string
```
