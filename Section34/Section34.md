# Data Access Pattern - Repositories

## The Repository Pattern

One central point governing access to some aspect of our database.  
Can be implemented as an object with plain functions, as an instance of a class,
as a class with static methods, etc.

This is all around interacting Postgres with a Node JS project. Not really interested in this.
